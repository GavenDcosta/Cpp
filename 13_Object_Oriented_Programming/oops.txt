OOPS -> Classes and Objects

C++ -> Initially called -> C with classes by stroustroup
Class -> Extensiom of Structures (in C)

Structures had limitations
  - members are public
  - No methods

Classes -> Structures + more 

classes c-> an have methods and properties
classes -> can make few members as private and few members as public

structure in c++ are typedef

you can declare objects along with class declaration
 -> class Employee{
       //Class defination
 } gaven, luffy, naruto;

 gaven.salarly = 100000 makes no sense if salarly is private
